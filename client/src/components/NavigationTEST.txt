//That’s called the render props pattern in React. What’s important is that it gives you access to the value
//which was passed before to the Provider pattern('userAuth' from withAuthentication.js file). Once the authenticated 
//user in the withAuthentication higher order component changes, it changes as well as the passed value in the Provider 
//component, and then also in the Consumer component. You don’t need to pass the authenticated user down from the App 
//component anymore. It is passed through it implicitly by using React’s context.
